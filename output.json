Every week, David and a guest take you inside the latest developments with insight and analysis from the key players in politics.\nFOLLOW\nThe Two-Month Sprint to Election Day\nThe 2024 presidential race has reached a key turning point. Labor Day has passed, Election Day is just over eight weeks away, and the presidential nominees are set to face off on the debate stage in just a few days. New battleground state polls by CNN this week showed a very tight race between former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris. Stuart Stevens is a former Republican consultant who worked on George W. Bush and Mitt Romney’s presidential campaigns. He’s now an author an...Show more\nSEP 6, 2024\n23 MINS\nThe Critical Latino Vote\nMore than 36 million Latinos are eligible to vote in the 2024 election, and both Democrats and Republicans are competing fiercely to win their votes. Earlier this summer, polls showed former President Donald Trump could build significantly on gains he made with Latino voters in 2020. But, with Vice President Kamala Harris now at the top of the Democratic ticket, those numbers could be shifting. Mark Hugo Lopez is the director of race and ethnicity research at Pew Research Center. He joins CNN Political Director David Chalian to take a closer look at this critical voting bloc and how the political views of Latino voters have changed in recent years.\nAUG 30, 2024\n21 MINS\nInside the DNC: How Democrats Have Pivoted Under Harris\nVice President Kamala Harris has officially accepted her party’s nomination for president at the Democratic National Convention—just a month after President Joe Biden stepped aside and gave her his endorsement. After joining the show for the Republican convention last month, POLITICO’s Ryan Lizza is back to talk all things DNC with CNN Political Director David Chalian. They met at the CNN-POLITICO Grill, steps from the convention floor inside Chicago’s United Center, and broke down what the first three nights of the convention revealed about how the Democrats’ strategy has shifted since Harris took Biden’s place at the top of the ticket.\nAUG 23, 2024\n27 MINS\nHarris on Policy, Then and Now\nSince Vice President Kamala Harris went from running mate to top of the ticket, her campaign has been light on details about her policy positions. She’s expected to start rolling out her economic agenda this week. Jasmine Wright is a political reporter for NOTUS, and she’s covered Kamala Harris since her 2019 run for the White House. She joins CNN Political Director David Chalian to break down how Harris is approaching issues like healthcare, the economy, and immigration this time around — and how Harris the candidate has changed since her last presidential campaign.\nAUG 16, 2024\n26 MINS\nWalz Brings Minnesota ‘Vibes’ to the Harris Ticket\nVice President Kamala Harris made headlines when she chose Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate this week. CNN's Chief National Affairs Correspondent Jeff Zeleny joins CNN Political Director David Chalian from the campaign trail to explain what went into the ‘vibes’-based decision, and the Midwestern Democrat’s ascent from history teacher to vice presidential hopeful.\nAUG 9, 2024\n26 MINS\nJD Vance Seeks To Find His Footing\nIn just a few years, Ohio Senator JD Vance has gone from author and conservative commentator to President Donald Trump’s running mate. Ohio Capital Journal reporter Nick Evans has been reporting on Vance’s career evolution since he ran for Senate. He joins CNN Political Director David Chalian to talk about how Vance is performing on the national stage.\nAUG 2, 2024\n30 MINS\nThe Kamala Harris Campaign Kicks Off\nDemocratic party leaders and donors are rallying around Vice President Kamala Harris as their presumptive presidential nominee. Harris finds herself in her second campaign for the presidency, but this one is in an entirely new context. So how did we get here? Astead Herndon is a national politics reporter for the New York Times and the host of the politics podcast, The Run Up. He previously covered Kamala Harris’ 2019 presidential campaign. He joins CNN Political Director David Chalian to explain how Harris meets this moment and what to expect in the next hundred days of her campaign.\nJUL 26, 2024\n25 MINS\nAs Republicans Embrace Trump, Biden Faces Pressure\nWhile former President Donald Trump received a hero’s welcome at the Republican National Convention, President Joe Biden is facing mounting pressure to drop out of the race. On the ground at the RNC, CNN’s Political Director David Chalian sits down with Ryan Lizza, POLITICO's Chief Washington Correspondent and host of the podcast “Playbook Deep Dive”. They talk about Biden’s candidacy teetering on possible collapse and how an assassination attempt on Trump’s life reshaped his convention.\nJUL 19, 2024\n26 MINS\nBiden Ignites Panic Among Democrats\nJoe Biden remains in the race for president, for now. But Democrats are divided over whether he should remain their nominee. CNN political commentator Karen Finney joins CNN Political Director David Chalian to explain how we got here and how the party moves forward from here.\nJUL 12, 2024\n28 MINS\nThe Aftermath of Biden’s Debate Performance\nPresident Joe Biden's performance on the debate stage last night created a panic in many corners of the Democratic party. CNN's Chief National Affairs Correspondent Jeff Zeleny joins David Chalian to talk about where both campaigns go from here, and what he considers “perhaps the story of our lifetimes.”\nJUN 28, 2024\n22 MINS\nShow more episodes"

Ship tracks typically form in areas where thin, low-lying stratus and cumulus clouds are present.\n\n...\n\nThe Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on Aqua captured this natural-color image of several ship tracks extending northward on August 26, 2018. The clouds were located about 1,000 kilometers (600 miles) west of the California-Oregon border. Similar environmental conditions also triggered the formation of ship tracks in this part of the Pacific on August 27 and 28."
